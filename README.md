Nearest Neighbor Classification

For the test sample, find the nearest sample in the training set.

The nearest neighbor can be found using SAD – sum of absolute distance

Assign the label of the NN to the test sample

(a) Creates the Gaussian filter with hsize = 3x3, 7x7 and 13x13. Apply image convolution to image 柴犬飛飛.jpg by three Gaussian filters, and compute the PSNR with the original image. [3 image]

(b) Creates the Gaussian filter with sigma = 1, 30 and 100 with hsize = 3x3. Apply image convolution to image 柴犬飛飛.jpg by three Gaussian filters, and compute the PSNR with the original image. [3 image]

(c) Compare and discuss the results from the above three methods and give the meaning of PSNR values to these results.

(d) Apply Unsharp mask、Edge detection mask to the 柴犬飛飛.jpg and show the results.
